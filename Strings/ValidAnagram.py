#Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.
#An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) != len(t): return False
        countS, countT = {}, {}
        for i in range(len(s)):
            countS[s[i]] = countS.get(s[i], 0) + 1
            countT[t[i]] = countT.get(t[i], 0) + 1
        
        return (countS == countT)
